## Introduction

This project is a simple Hangman Game in Python. As someone who is just embarking on my journey into programming
in Python, I created this game as a learning exercise. It's designed to be straightforward yet engaging, the game randomly selects
a seceret word from a list of seceret words and the player gets limited chances to guess the word. 

## Learning Journey

This game is a testament to the initial steps of my programming journey, emphasizing the learning process and the application of 
fundamental Python concepts. As such, it's crafted with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for other beginners who might
be interested in exploring basic project development and coding practices.
